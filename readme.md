## üß† Core Logic Explained
The calculator's projections are based on two standard financial formulas:

Future Value (FV) of a Series: This calculates the projected nest egg at retirement. The formula accounts for your current savings (principal), regular monthly contributions, and compound interest over time.

Future Value (FV) = P * (1 + r)^n + PMT * [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r]
‚Äã
 
The 4% Rule: This is a common guideline used to estimate the total savings needed for retirement. It suggests you need a nest egg large enough to allow you to withdraw 4% of it annually to cover your living expenses.

Target Nest Egg = Desired Annual Income / 0.04‚Äã
